Indonesian publisher M&C! announced on Tuesday that it has licensed Kumichō's Bocchi the Rock! manga. M&C! did not reveal the release date for the first volume.

The manga follows Hitori "Bocchi-chan" ("Loner") Gotō, a lonely high school girl whose heart lies in her guitar. She does nothing every day except strum her guitar by herself at home. However, she happens one day to meet Nijika Ijichi, who is looking for a guitarist for her group named "Kessoku Band."

Hamaji launched the Bocchi the Rock! manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Max magazine in December 2017, and the series is ongoing. Houbunsha published the manga's sixth compiled book volume in August 2023.

The manga's television anime premiered in October 2022. Aniplus-Asia aired the anime in Southeast Asia as it aired in Japan. The anime will have two compilation films opening in spring and summer 2024.
